        "abstract": "Context: Software product line engineering has proven to be an efficient paradigm to developing families of similar software systems at lower costs, in shorter time, and with higher quality. Objective: This paper analyzes the literature on product lines from 1995 to 2014, identifying the most influential publications, the most researched topics, and how the interest in those topics has evolved along the way. Method: Bibliographic data have been gathered from ISI Web of Science and Scopus. The data have been examined using two prominent bibliometric approaches: science mapping and performance analysis. Results: According to the study carried out, (i) software architecture was the initial motor of research in SPL; (ii) work on systematic software reuse has been essential for the development of the area; and (iii) feature modeling has been the most important topic for the last fifteen years, having the best evolution behavior in terms of number of published papers and received citations. Conclusion: Science mapping has been used to identify the main researched topics, the evolution of the interest in those topics and the relationships among topics. Performance analysis has been used to recognize the most influential papers, the journals and conferences that have published most papers, how numerous is the literature on product lines and what is its distribution over time.",

        "abstract": "Context: Developing secure software systems is an issue of ever-growing importance. Researchers have generally come to acknowledge that to develop such systems successfully, their security features must be incorporated in the context of a systematic approach: a security methodology. There are a number of such methodologies in the literature, but no single security methodology is adequate for every situation, requiring the construction of ''fit-to-purpose'' methodologies or the tailoring of existing methodologies to the project specifics at hand. While a large body of research exists addressing the same requirement for development methodologies - constituting the field of Method Engineering - there is nothing comparable for security methodologies as such; in fact, the topic has never been studied before in such a context. Objective: In this paper we draw inspiration from a number of Method Engineering ideas and fill the latter gap by proposing a comprehensive approach to engineering security methodologies. Method: Our approach is embodied in three interconnected parts: a framework of interrelated security process patterns; a security-specific meta-model; and a meta-methodology to guide engineers in using the latter artefacts in a step-wise fashion. A UML-inspired notation is used for representing all pattern-based methodology models during design and construction. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by tailoring an existing, real-life security methodology to a distributed-system-specific project situation. Results: The paper proposes a novel pattern-oriented approach to modeling, constructing, tailoring and combining security methodologies, which is the very first and currently sole such approach in the literature. We illustrate and evaluate our approach in an academic setting, and perform a feature analysis to highlight benefits and deficiencies. Conclusion: Using our proposal, developers, architects and researchers can analyze and engineer security methodologies in a structured, systematic fashion, taking into account all security methodology aspects. \\\\textcopyright 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Some contributions have focused on integrating security aspects, mainly access control mechanisms, at the implementation phase. Others pay a particular attention to the capture and analysis of security requirements. However, to our knowledge, no method addresses the whole problem of the specification of security requirements and their transformation through all the phases of the IS development life cycle. We argue that better Secured IS can be obtained if security issues are taken into account at an earlier phase of the system life cycle and integrated with functional aspects along the whole life cycle. This paper is a step forward to a comprehensive security conceptual meta-model encompassing the main security properties such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. It integrates functional and non-functional requirements. It includes social, organizational as well as informational aspects. This meta-model is the backbone of our approach. 2011 ACM.",

        "abstract": "Many embedded systems not only affect their context through actuators but also are affected by the context through sensors. It is important to provide a context-dependent development method for constructing safe and reliable embedded systems. However, most of the current requirements analysis methods do not explicitly provide a systematic way for deciding the boundary of the context that should be taken into account because it is essentially difficult to decide which context element should be included as the targets of requirements analysis. If a developer explores the context boundary in an ad-hoc manner, he or she will be faced with the frame problem because there are unlimited context elements in the real world where the target system exists. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a context-dependent requirements analysis method called CAMEmb (Context Analysis Method for Embedded systems) in which only the value-context elements are extracted as the associated context elements. Applying the guide words provided by CAMEmb, we can explore only a sequence of context elements directly or indirectly affecting the data value observed or controlled by the system sensors and actuators. Other context elements not affecting the system observation and control are not taken into account because these context elements do not affect the system behavior. Using CAMEmb and lightweight formal tools, we can explore the context boundary that guarantees the expected system behavior. We developed CAMEmbModeler, a support tool consisting of a CAMEmb-based modeling editor and a model compiler that transforms system and context models into the design model reflecting the context boundary. 2011 IEEE.",

Over the past decade, we have explored different facets of model-driven security. This research includes different modeling languages, code generators, model analysis tools, and even model transformations. For example, in multifitier systems, we used model transformations to transform a security policy, formulated for a system's data model, to a security policy governing the behavior of the system's graphical user interface.

Novel attacks and changing laws lead to security issues that did not necessarily rise from a flawed initial design, but also when the system fails to keep up with a changing environment. Thus, security requires maintenance throughout the operation phase. Ongoing adaptations in response to changed security knowledge are inevitable. A necessary prerequisite for such adaptations is a good understanding of the security-relevant parts of the system and the security knowledge. We present a model-based framework for supporting the maintenance of security during the long-term evolution of a software system. It uses ontologies to manage the system-specific and the security knowledge. With model queries, graph transformation and differencing techniques, knowledge changes are analyzed and the system model is adapted. We introduce the novel concept of Security Maintenance Rules to couple the evolution of security knowledge with co-evolutions of the system model. As evaluation, community knowledge about vulnerabilities is used (Common Weakness Enumeration database). We show the applicability of the framework to the iTrust system from the medical care domain and hence show the benefits of supporting co-evolution for maintaining secure systems.",

The aim of this paper is to address the gap that exists between end-users' trust concerns and the lack of implementation of proper trustworthiness requirements. New technologies like cloud computing bring new capabilities for hosting and offering complex collaborative business operations. However, these advances might bring undesirable side effects, e.g., introducing new vulnerabilities and threats caused by collaboration and data exchange over the Internet. Hence, users become more concerned about trust. Trust is subjective; trustworthiness requirements for addressing trust concerns are difficult to elicit, especially if there are different parties involved in the business process. We propose a user-centered trustworthiness requirement analysis and modeling framework. We integrate the subjective trust concerns into goal models and embed them into business process models as objective trustworthiness requirements. Business process model and notation is extended to enable modeling trustworthiness requirements. This paper focuses on the challenges of elicitation, refinement and modeling trustworthiness requirements. An application example from the healthcare domain is used to demonstrate our approach. 2017 by the authors.",

Writing requirements that can achieve the purpose of building the right system is only possible if the domain knowledge of the system-to-be and its environment is known and considered thoroughly. We consider this as the context problem of software development. In the past, we tackled this problem by describing common structures and stakeholders for several different domains. The common elements of the context were obtained from observations about the domain in terms of standards, domain specific p u blications a n d i m plementations. But the d escription of t h e structure of a context-pattern, especially in terms of its static structure, was not aligned. This inhibits relating context-patterns to form a pattern language. It is also difficult for inexperienced pattern creators to describe newly observed patterns without any guidance. We propose a meta model for describing context-patterns. The meta model contains elements, which can be used to structure and describe domain knowledge in a generic form. These context-patterns can afterwards be instantiated with the domain knowledge required for software engineering. This work is based on already existing patterns, which we abstracted into a meta-model. We present our context-patterns, show how we used them to construct our meta-model, and provide an example of how to describe a context-pattern using our meta-model. We contribute this meta model as a basis for a pattern language for context elicitation. Copyright 2015 ACM.",

        "abstract": "Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. All Rights Reserved. Quality security requirements contribute to the success of secure software development. However, the process of eliciting security requirements is tedious and complex. It also requires requirements engineers to have security experience in the process of eliciting consistent security requirements from the clients-stakeholders. Most of the requirements engineers faced problems in eliciting consistent security compliance requirements from the clients-stakeholders as they misunderstood the real needs and the security term used. Thus, this resulted to inconsistent security requirements being elicited. The inconsistency leads to incorrect and insecure software systems being developed as well as to disruptions of schedule and increase of a project's expenditure. Motivated by these problems, this study is aimed to propose a new approach for consistency validation of functional security requirements. Here, security requirements specifications will be collected from software vendors to analyse the flow of functional security requirements process. Next, visual differencing will be integrated to cross-validate the consistency of the elicited functional security requirements with the best-practise template. Here, security requirements best-practice template pattern library will be designed and a new mathematical formulation that defines the consistency validation rules of security requirements will also be constructed. The formulation will be based on the security-related semi-formalised model, called SecEssential Use Case (SecEUC).This approach will then be realised with a proof of concept prototype tool and will be compared with the existing approaches, focusing on its ability to validate the inconsistency of the functional security requirements. Finally, this study is believed could provide a positive impact to the software industry by reducing the development cost as it allows the requirements engineers to validate the inconsistency that occurs in the elicited security compliance requirements at the early stage of the secure software development.",

        "abstract": "The focus on secure software development has been growing steadily in all phases of the software development life cycle. Security awareness in the requirements engineering stage of software development is important in building secure software. One of the major issues faced by the software industry is that many organizations undertake secure software development initiatives without knowing whether they are ready to undertake them. Currently, there is no model to measure the readiness of security requirements engineering in an organization. The objective of this paper is to develop a security requirements engineering readiness model (SRERM) to enable organizations to assess their security requirements engineering (SRE) readiness levels. In order to achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was conducted to identify the relevant studies in the SRE domain. A total of 104 primary studies were identified, and available evidence was synthesized into 12 security requirements categories and 76 best practices to build a SRERM. Initially, two case studies were conducted in order to evaluate the SRERM in a real-world environment. Based on the outcomes of the two case studies, some modifications were proposed to further improve the SRERM. After modifying the SRERM, two more case studies were conducted in order to evaluate the modifications made to the SRERM. The case study results indicate that the SRERM has the ability to identify the readiness levels of SRE in the software industry.",

Despite the importance of KM for the success of knowledge-intensive organizations, the concept of RE for KM solutions is still vague lacking. Its definitions and guidelines for addressing the different facets of KM during the RE process are yet to be well-defined, encompassing social and technical aspects thereof. Applying the design science research paradigm by using a method engineering methodology, the KM-REM method was developed and implemented in a case study involving a global IT provider firm. This allowed for a comprehensive analysis and requirements specification for a KM solution, which was validated based on expert (managers) evaluation. KM-REM provides comprehensive, practical guidance and tools for KM analysts and RE professionals, for conducting KM-oriented RE, toward enhancing knowledge-intensive business processes with embedded KM solutions. Moreover, KM-REM facilitates tractability in the RE process, by focusing on manageable KM requirements. Thus, the contribution of KM-REM is threefold. First, it extends the research on RE for KM solutions as a specialized area within the RE discipline. Second, it cohesively organizes the RE dimensions and modeling principles for KM, providing customized guidelines and tools. Third, it demonstrates how the perspectives of traditional RE methods can be extended to include social and cultural aspects.",

A major practical limitation to open MASs is security because the openness of such systems negates many traditional security solutions. In this paper we introduce and classify main attacks on open MASs. We then survey and analyse various security techniques in the literature and categorise them under prevention and detection approaches. Finally, we suggest which security technique is an appropriate countermeasure for which classes of attack. 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

        "abstract": "iStar is a general-purpose goal-based modelling language used to model requirements at early and late phases of software development. It has been used in industrial and academic projects. Often the language is extended to incorporate new constructs related to an application area. The language is currently undergoing standardisation, so several studies have focused on the analysis of iStar variations to identify the similarities and defining a core iStar. However, we believe it will continue to be extended and it is important to understand how iStar is extended. This paper contributes to this purpose through the identification and analysis of the existing extensions and its constructs. A Systematic Literature Review was conducted to guide identification and analysis. The results point to 96 papers and 307 constructs proposed. The extensions and constructs were analysed according to well-defined questions in three dimensions: a general analysis; model-based analysis (to characterise the extensions from semantic and syntactic definitions); and a third dimension related to semiotic clarity. The application area targeted by the iStar extensions and their evolutions are presented as results of our analysis. The results point to the need for more complete, consistent and careful development of iStar extensions. The paper concludes with some discussions and future directions for this research field.",

There is no comprehensive framework to describe all different concepts relating to software quality in a common way. In this paper we present a general quality model, providing the possibility to describe very different concepts related to quality. We show that our quality model is able to integrate the various concepts found in standards, quality models, guidelines, and static code checker rules. Furthermore, we show that the quality model is able to describe the interrelations of disciplines, like requirements engineering and software test, to software quality.

Security is a semantic aspect of applications and their constraints on the application should de described at this moment. From a security point of view we only want to indicate which specific security controls are needed, rather than getting involved with low-level design and implementation details. Therefore, at these stages, it is useful to have a set of patterns which define abstract security mechanisms. These patterns should specify only the fundamental characteristics of the security mechanism or service, not specific software aspects. We present the concept of Abstract Security Pattern (ASP), which describes a conceptual security mechanism that realizes one or more security policies able to handle a threat or comply with a security-related regulation or institutional policy. We present a detailed example of an ASP. We relate ASPs to each other using pattern diagrams as well as to Security Solution Frames and tactics. Finally, we discuss their value for defining security requirements and for building secure systems.",

        "abstract": "Software-as-a-service (SaaS) multi-tenancy in cloud-based applications helps service providers to save cost, improve resource utilization, and reduce service customization and maintenance time. This is achieved by sharing of resources and service instances among multiple \"tenants\" of the cloud-hosted application. However, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to SaaS applications required capabilities. Security is one of these key requirements that must be addressed when engineering multi-tenant SaaS applications. The sharing of resources among tenants - i.e. multi-tenancy - increases tenants\\' concerns about the security of their cloud-hosted assets. Compounding this, existing traditional security engineering approaches do not fit well with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements often emerge after the applications and services were first developed. The resultant applications do not usually support diverse security capabilities based on different tenants\\' needs, some of which may change at run-time i.e. after cloud application deployment. We introduce a novel model-driven security engineering approach for multi-tenant, cloud-hosted SaaS applications. Our approach is based on externalizing security from the underlying SaaS application, allowing both application/service and security to evolve at runtime. Multiple security sets can be enforced on the same application instance based on different tenants\\' security requirements. We use abstract models to capture service provider and multiple tenants\\' security requirements and then generate security integration and configurations at runtime. We use dependency injection and dynamic weaving via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to integrate security within critical application/service entities at runtime. We explain our approach, architecture and implementation details, discuss a usage example, and present an evaluation of our approach on a set of open source web applications. \\\\textcopyright 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of methods have been proposed to identify and analyze threats and security requirements, but there are few empirical evaluations that show these methods work in practice. This paper reports a controlled experiment conducted with 28 master students to compare two classes of risk-based methods, visual methods (CORAS) and textual methods (SREP). The aim of the experiment was to compare the effectiveness and perception of the two methods. The participants divided in groups solved four different tasks by applying the two methods using a randomized block design. The dependent variables were effectiveness of the methods measured as number of threats and security requirements identified, and perception of the methods measured through a post-task questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The experiment was complemented with participants' interviews to determine which features of the methods influence their effectiveness. The main findings were that the visual method is more effective for identifying threats than the textual one, while the textual method is slightly more effective for eliciting security requirements. In addition, visual method overall perception and intention to use were higher than for the textual method. 2013 IEEE.",

There is limited industrial experience and evidence of successful applications of Agile methods in this domain; however, academic research has identified some of the key challenges of their adoption and application, and has started to present feasibility studies. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach for developing safety-critical software, making two novel contributions. Firstly, we address the notion of up-front design in safety-critical software development, and describe the characteristics of an up-front design that is minimal from the perspective of achieving safety objectives. Secondly, we identify a key difficulty of using iterative development for building safety-critical software, and present a way to develop both a software system and a safety argument iteratively. We also give details of a proof-of-concept example illustrating the use of the approach. 2010 IEEE.",

Thus, it requires security knowledge to be explicitly represented, and well understood by system analysts and designer, which in turn being applied in feasible problem contexts. System requirements are often represented in modelling frameworks with different analytical focus, so security requirements knowledge shall reflect such difference and form an integrated treatment. This paper proposes to use modelling concepts from the i* and PF modeling language to capture recurring patterns of security problems. The main concepts used are actors, assets, and relations such as ownership and permissions. The major contribution of the approach is proposing the specific problem frames such as ownership, authorization, attack and protection, by decomposing a large problem into sub-problems (base frames), then evaluate the potential threats (attacking frames) applicable to each sub-problem by evaluate the compatibility of the two, security analysis is integrated into the system design process from the outset. The proposal can be generalized to the design of defensive measures as well as other NFR treatments. 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Developers have to ensure that their systems meet certain security requirements. Structured argumentation can be a powerful tool for developers to deal with system behavior, vulnerabilities, and threats. Haley's framework is based on construction of a context for the system, representing security requirements as constraints, and developing satisfaction arguments for the security requirements. Incomplete and uncertain information and limited resources force the developers to settle for good-enough security. Risk assessment in Security Argumentation (RISA) extends Haley's method with risk assessment. RISA uses publicly available catalogs of security expertise and most common attack patterns to support risk assessment. These catalogs provide valuable information to the assessment process and help the developers identify mitigations for security requirements satisfaction. RISA developers stated the most pressing issue of their future work is the validation of RISA. In previous studies, no validation of RISA framework has been done on a complex system. Hence, this work evaluates RISA framework by applying it to the security requirements analysis of the address generation module of the decentralized, peer-to-peer communication protocol Bit Message. In addition, based on this analysis, we suggest a new set of requirements to improve the security of the current Bit Message client version. 2014 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Incorporating security features is one of the most important and challenging tasks in designing distributed systems. Over the last decade, researchers and practitioners have come to recognize that the incorporation of security features should proceed by means of a structured, systematic approach, combining principles from both software and security engineering. Such systematic approaches, particularly those implying some sort of process aligned with the development life-cycle, are termed security methodologies. There are a number of security methodologies in the literature, of which the most flexible and, according to a recent survey, most satisfactory from an industry-adoption viewpoint are methodologies that encapsulate their security solutions in some fashion, especially via the use of security patterns. While the literature does present several mature pattern-driven security methodologies with either a general or a highly specific system applicability, there are currently no (pattern-driven) security methodologies specifically designed for general distributed systems. Going further, there are also currently no methodologies with mixed specific applicability, e.g. for both general and peer-to-peer distributed systems. In this paper we aim to fill these gaps by presenting a comprehensive pattern-driven security methodology - arrived at by applying a previously devised approach to engineering security methodologies - specifically designed for general distributed systems, which is also capable of taking into account the specifics of peer-to-peer systems as needed. Our methodology takes the principle of encapsulation several steps further, by employing patterns not only for the incorporation of security features (via security solution frames), but also for the modeling of threats, and even as part of its process. We illustrate and evaluate the presented methodology in detail via a realistic example - the development of a distributed system for file sharing and collaborative editing. In both the presentation of the methodology and example our focus is on the early life-cycle phases (analysis and design). 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Security methodologies represent systematic approaches for introducing security attributes into a system throughout the development lifecycle. While isolated attempts have been made to demonstrate the value of particular security methodologies, the \u201cquality\u201d of security methodologies, as such, has never been given due consideration; indeed, it has never been studied as a self-standing topic. The literature therefore entirely lacks supportive artifacts that can provide a basis for assessing, and hence for improving, a security methodology's quality. In this paper, we fill the aforementioned gap by proposing a comprehensive quality framework and accompanying process, within the context of an existing approach to engineering security methodologies, which can be used for both (bottom-up) quality assessment and (top-down) quality improvement. The main framework elements can be extended and customized to allow an essentially arbitrary range of methodology features to be considered, thus forming a basis for flexible, fine-grained quality control. We demonstrate the bottom-up application of the latter framework and process on three real-life security methodologies for distributed systems, taken as case studies. Based on the assessment results, we subsequently show in detail (for one) and briefly discuss (for the remaining set) how the case study methodologies can be re-engineered to improve their quality. 2018 John Wiley \\\\& Sons, Ltd.",

However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and comprehensive understanding of the research and practice regarding assumptions and their management. Objective This work aims to explore and analyze the state of the art on assumptions and their management in software development. Method A systematic mapping study that covers the literature from January 2001 to December 2015 on assumptions and their management in software development. Results 134 studies were included: (1) The studies were published in 94 venues, which indicates that assumptions and their management has been a broad topic in software engineering. (2) Only 21 studies defined the assumption concept. (3) Most assumptions are made for or related to the artifacts in requirements engineering and software design, which demonstrates that assumptions should be managed from the early phases of software development. (4) Much effort has been put on Assumptions Making, Description, and Evaluation. Assumptions Maintenance received moderate attention. More than half of the tools identified aim to support assume-guarantee reasoning. For the other tools, most of them can be used to support Assumptions Description. (5) All the identified types of stakeholders are involved in Assumptions Making, followed by Evaluation and Description. Stakeholders involved in requirements engineering, software design, and software construction play a central role in assumptions management. (6) The main challenge is the difficulty of performing assumptions management activities in software development. (7) The identified assumptions management approaches, tools, benefits, and lessons learned are limited to their specific contexts (e.g., context of use). (8) Most of the negative consequences are caused by invalid or implicit assumptions. Conclusions This work provides researchers and practitioners with a reflection of the past fifteen years of research and practice on assumptions and their management in software development.",

        "abstract": "Since security is recommended to be evaluated at the beginning of the software development process, specifying software security requirements is inevitable in developing Critical Information Security Systems. However, according to the ISO/IEC 15408 (known as Common Criteria), determining detailed software security requirements (SRs) is quite challenging, complex which needs lots of expert knowledge of security. In this paper, a data-driven Functionality Topic-Security Requirement (FT-SR) model is proposed to recommend software SRs based on the relationship between software functionality specification and SRs from software Security Target (ST) which have been written in accordance with ISO/IEC 15408. First, we extract descriptions of functionality and tag SRs all from software STs. Second, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is adopted to build functionality topics for product functionality description. Third, a FT-SR model is developed based on the mapping between product functionality topics and SRs which have been tagged in ST documents. Finally, a recommendation strategy is proposed to recommend SRs based on the FT-SR model for software products.

        "abstract": "Mobile application usage has become widespread and significant as it allows interactions between people and services anywhere and anytime. However, issues related to security have become a major concern among mobile users as insecure applications may lead to security vulnerabilities that make them easily compromised by hackers. Thus, it is important for mobile application developers to validate security requirements of mobile apps at the earliest stage to prevent potential security problems. In this paper, we describe our automated approach and tool, called MobiMEReq that helps to capture and validate the security attributes requirements of mobile apps. We employed the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD) with a model-based testing strategy using Essential Use Cases (EUCs) and Essential User Interface (EUI) models. We also conducted an evaluation to compare the performance and correctness of our tool in various application domains. The results of the study showed that our tool is able to help requirements engineers to easily capture and validate security-related requirements of mobile applications.

        "abstract": "The Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of web applications aims to enhance the quality attributes of released applications. Security is among of the important attributes during the penetration testing phase. Web Application Vulnerability Scanners (WAVS) help the developers to identify existing vulnerabilities that could compromise the security and privacy of data exchanged between the client and web server during the development and deployment phases. WAVS are used during the deployment phase to continuously evaluate the security of web applications by checking for possible vulnerabilities that can threaten the client services. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and accuracy of five WAVSs (Acunetix WVS, Burp Suite, NetSparker, Nessus and OWASP ZAP) to identify possible vulnerabilities of web applications. The selected scanners are among the top ten recommended web vulnerability scanning software for 2017. The method of black box testing was adopted to evaluate the five WAVSs against seven vulnerable web applications. The evaluation is based on different measures such as the vulnerabilities severity level, types of detected vulnerabilities, numbers of false positive vulnerabilities and the accuracy of each scanner. The evaluation is conducted based on an extracted list of vulnerabilities from OWASP and NIST. The accuracy of each scanner was measured based on the identification of true and false positives. The results show that Acunetix and NetSparker had the best accuracy with the lowest rate of false positives.",

Hence, requirements engineers need to have security knowledge when eliciting and analyzing the security requirements from business requirements. However, the majority of requirements engineers lack such knowledge and skills, and they face difficulties to capture and understand many security terms and issues. This results in capturing inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete security requirements that in turn may lead to insecure software systems. In this paper, we describe a new approach of capturing security requirements using an extended Essential Use Cases (EUCs) model. This approach enhances the process of capturing and analyzing security requirements to produce accurate and complete requirements.

After a classification of relevant change scenarios, we identify challenges for change-driven transformations. As the main technical contribution of the current paper, we define an expressive, high-level language for specifying change-driven transformations as an extension of graph patterns and graph transformation rules. This language generalizes previous results on live model transformations by offering trigger events for arbitrarily complex model changes, and dedicated reactions for specific kinds of changes, making this way the concept of change to be a first-class citizen of the transformation language. We discuss how the underlying transformation engine needs to be adapted in order to use the same language uniformly for different change scenarios. The technicalities of our approach will be discussed on a (1) model synchronization case study with non-materialized target models and (2) a case study on detecting the violation of evolutionary (temporal) constraints in the security requirements engineering domain. 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

In the future, it is expected that gamification will overtake the traditional way of learning resulting in issues such as scalability, upgradation of learning modules. To address these issues, merging gamification with cloud computing seems a viable solution. However, the employability of gamification through cloud computing is still in its infant stage. Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified. Moreover, a specific cloud-assisted gamification architecture is proposed and discussed together with its possible applications.

CC achieves this by evaluating the product or system conformance with a common set of requirements set forth by it. To engineer a product that meets the information assurance goals of CC, a structured and comprehensive methodology is required to drive the activities undertaken in all the stages of the software requirements engineering (RE) process. Such a methodology is inevitable to understand and attain the Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA). As an effort in this direction, we focus on the use of object-oriented ontology modeling as an effective way of representing and enforcing the given common set of requirements established by CC. Our methodology leverages novel techniques from software requirement engineering and knowledge engineering. This paper also describes how this methodology can effectively realize CC-related requirements of the target systems and help evaluate such systems for conformance to the certification and accreditation (C\\\\&A) process.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing services bring new capabilities for hosting and offering complex collaborative business operations. However, these advances might bring undesirable side-effects, e.g., introducing new vulnerabilities and threats caused by collaboration and data exchange over the Internet. Hence, users have become more concerned about security and privacy aspects. For secure provisioning of a cloud computing service, security and privacy issues must be addressed by using a risk assessment method. To perform a risk assessment, it is necessary to obtain all relevant information about the context of the considered cloud computing service. The context analysis of a cloud computing service and its underlying system is a difficult task because of the variety of different types of information that have to be considered. This context information includes (i) legal, regulatory and/or contractual requirements that are relevant for a cloud computing service (indirect stakeholders); (ii) relations to other involved cloud computing services; (iii) high-level cloud system components that support the involved cloud computing services; (iv) data that is processed by the cloud computing services; and (v) stakeholders that interact directly with the cloud computing services and/or the underlying cloud system components. We present a pattern for the contextual analysis of cloud computing services and demonstrate the instantiation of our proposed pattern with real-life application examples. Our pattern contains elements that represent the above-mentioned types of contextual information. The elements of our pattern conform to the General Data Protection Regulation. Besides the context analysis, our pattern supports the identification of high-level assets. Additionally, our proposed pattern supports the documentation of the scope and boundaries of a cloud computing service conforming to the requirements of the ISO 27005 standard (information security risk management). The results of our context analysis contribute to the transparency of the achieved security and privacy level of a cloud computing service. This transparency can increase the trust of users in a cloud computing service. We present results of the RestAssured project related to the context analysis regarding cloud computing services and their underlying cloud computing systems. The context analysis is the prerequisite to threat and control identification that are performed later in the risk management process. The focus of this paper is the use of a pattern at the time of design systematic context analysis and scope definition for risk management methods.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays many organizations experience security incidents due to unauthorized access to information. To reduce the risk of such incidents, security policies are often employed to regulate access to information. Such policies, however, are often too restrictive, and users do not have the rights necessary to perform assigned duties. As a consequence, access control mechanisms are perceived by users as a barrier and thus bypassed, making the system insecure. In this paper, we draw a bridge between the social concept of conviviality and access control. Conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for ambient intelligence and multi-agent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user-friendliness of systems. To bridge the gap between conviviality and security, we propose a methodological framework for updating and adapting access control policies based on conviviality recommendations. Our methodology integrates and extends existing techniques to assist system designers in the derivation of access control policies from socio-technical requirements of the system, while taking into account the conviviality of the system. We illustrate our framework using the Ambient Assisted Living use case from the HotCity of Luxembourg. 2014, Springer-Verlag London.",

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity compliance analysis is the process of assessing whether the behavior of an IT system or application conforms to the cybersecurity rules and regulations in force. This assessment can be offered as a service by exploiting available cloud technologies, and, indeed, it is one of the services classified by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) as part of the security information and event management (SIEM) category of the SecaaS (security as a service) domain. The definition and implementation of this typology of cloud services are challenging activities due to the complexity of both the reference business domain and the compliance analysis services to be provided themselves. The paper exploits a recently proposed requirements methodology, called GOReM(goal-oriented requirements methodology), to support the conceptualization and subsequent implementation of cybersecurity compliance analysis services. In particular, two different application scenarios regarding compliance analysis of an existing or under development IT system/ application are presented and discussed. In both the scenarios, GOReM allows to grasp and understand the many and complex issues to address for providing secure cloud services toworldwide customers, also due to the numerous, different and ever changing legal aspects, which have to be taken into account by service providers. 2017 John Wiley \\\\& Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In a previous publication we introduced a catalog of context-patterns. Each context pattern describes common structures and stakeholders for a specific domain. The common elements of the context were obtained from observations about the domain in terms of standards, domain specific-publications, and implementations. Whenever the domain of a system-to-be is already described by a context-pattern, one can use this context-pattern to elicit domain knowledge by instantiating the corresponding context-pattern. Moreover, we analyzed the common concepts in our context-patterns and created a meta-model to describe the relations between these concepts. This meta-model was the initial step towards a pattern language for context-patterns. In this work, we show the consequent next step for the definition of a pattern language syntax for context-patterns. Thus, we describe how to derive the connections between the existing context-pattern in a structured way and present the results. Copyright 2014 ACM.",

        "abstract": "Context: Data warehouses are systems which integrate heterogeneous sources to support the decision making process. Data from the Web is becoming increasingly more important as sources for these systems, which has motivated the extensive use of XML to facilitate data and metadata interchange among heterogeneous data sources from the Web and the data warehouse. However, the business information that data warehouses manage is highly sensitive and must, therefore, be carefully protected. Security is thus a key issue in the design of data warehouses, regardless of the implementation technology. It is important to note that the idiosyncrasy of the unstructured and semi-structured data requires particular security rules that have been specifically tailored to these systems in order to permit their particularities to be captured correctly. Unfortunately, although security issues have been considered in the development of traditional data warehouses, current research lacks approaches with which to consider security when the target platform is based on XML technology. Objective: We shall focus on defining transformations to obtain a secure XML Schema from the conceptual multidimensional model of a data warehouse. Method: We have first defined the rationale behind the transformation rules and how they have been developed in natural language, and we have then established them clearly and formally by using the QVT language. Finally, in order to validate our proposal we have carried out a case study. Results: We have proposed an approach for the model driven development of Secure XML Data Warehouses, defining a set of QVT transformation rules. Conclusion: The main benefit of our proposal is that it is possible to model security requirements together with the conceptual model of the data warehouse during the early stages of a project, and automatically obtain the corresponding implementation for XML. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Software systems are becoming more and more critical in every domain of human society. These systems are used not only by corporates and governments, but also by individuals and across networks of organizations. The wide use of software systems has resulted in the need to contain a large amount of critical information and processes, which certainly need to remain secure. As a consequence, it is important to ensure that the systems are secure by considering security requirements at the early phases of software development life cycle. In this paper, we propose to consider security requirements as functional requirements and apply model-oriented security requirements engineering framework as a systematic solution to elicit security requirements for e-governance software systems. As the result, high level of security can be achieved by more coverage of assets and threats, and identifying more traces of vulnerabilities in the early stages of requirements engineering. This in turn will help to elicit effective security requirements as countermeasures with business requirements. 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

In case of false information, it may cause harm to human life. So this system needs more security to protect the credential information. E-Health system is the most security sensitive process handled electronically. The highest achievable security is never too much for an E-Health system. So when system is being built, tasks such as Security Requirements Elicitation, Specification and Validation are essential to assure the Quality of the resulting secure E-Health system. By considering the Security requirements as functional requirements in the Requirement phase, the completeness of Security Requirements for E-Health system can be developed.

        "abstract": "Several development approaches have been proposed to handle the growing complexity of software system design. The most popular methods use models as the main artifacts to construct and maintain. The desired role of such models is to facilitate, systematize and standardize the construction of software-based systems. In our work, we propose a model-driven engineering (MDE) methodological approach associated with a pattern-based approach to support the development of secure software systems. We address the idea of using patterns to describe solutions for security as recurring security problems in specific design contexts and present a well-proven generic scheme for their solutions. The proposed approach is based on metamodeling and model transformation techniques to define patterns at different levels of abstraction and generate different representations according to the target domain concerns, respectively. Moreover, we describe an operational architecture for development tools to support the approach. Finally, an empirical evaluation of the proposed approach is presented through a practical application to a use case in the metrology domain with strong security requirements, which is followed by a description of a survey performed among domain experts to better understand their perceptions regarding our approach.",

The inputs of this process include a reference model from previous researcher and existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database. An interesting aim is to find out how we can make the secured software framework implementable in practice. In order to answer this question, some inquiries were set out regarding reference model and meta-process for classification to be a workable measurement system. The outputs of the process are the results discussion of experimental result and expert's validation. The experimental result use the existing CVE database which serves as an analysis when a) the framework is applied on three mix datasets, and b) when the framework is applied on two focus datasets. The first explains the result when the framework is applied on the CVE data randomly which consist mix of vendors and the latter is applied on the CVE data randomly but on selective vendors. The metric used in this assessment are precision and recall rate. The result shows there is a strong indicator that the framework can produce acceptable output accuracy. Apart from that, several experts' views were discussed to show the correctness and eliminate the ambiguity of classification rules and to prove the whole framework process. 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",

A CIA can have different forms depending on the execution context of the application and the location of the programming flaw that leads to the attack. Currently, CIAs are considered one of the most damaging classes of application attacks since they can severely affect an organisation's infrastructure and cause financial and reputational damage to it. In this paper we examine and categorize the countermeasures developed to detect the various attack forms. In particular, we identify two distinct categories. The first incorporates static program analysis tools used to eliminate flaws that can lead to such attacks during the development of the system. The second involves the use of dynamic detection safeguards that prevent code injection attacks while the system is in production mode. Our analysis is based on nonfunctional characteristics that are considered critical when creating security mechanisms. Such characteristics involve usability, overhead, implementation dependencies, false positives and false negatives. Our categorization and analysis can help both researchers and practitioners either to develop novel approaches, or use the appropriate mechanisms according to their needs. 2017 Mitropoulos and Spinellis.",

        "abstract": "Automatic translation of elicited consumer security requirements at high level (problem space) into application or service level security requirements (solution space) has been traditionally the Achilles' heel of security requirements engineering. Such automated translation would result in significant failure and cost reduction in application development and maintenance, particularly in those complex applications based on compositions and choreographies of services. In this paper we present a framework which makes a step forward to solve this dilemma. The framework supports the engineering of composite service security and trust requirements directly derived from the organisational needs expressed for such service. The followed approach starts with the modelling of organisation actors' objectives and commitments among these actors, and follows with the transformation of such commitments into security elements in the service business process specification and into a consumer security policy which the service will need to be compliant with.

        "abstract": "Tracing and integrating security requirements throughout the development process is a key challenge in security engineering. In socio-technical systems, security requirements for the organizational and technical aspects of a system are currently dealt with separately, giving rise to substantial misconceptions and errors. In this paper, we present a model-based security engineering framework for supporting the system design on the organizational and technical level. The key idea is to allow the involved experts to specify security requirements in the languages they are familiar with: business analysts use BPMN for procedural system descriptions; system developers use UML to design and implement the system architecture. Security requirements are captured via the language extensions SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. We provide a model transformation to bridge the conceptual gap between SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. Using UMLsec policies, various security properties of the resulting architecture can be verified. In a case study featuring an air traffic management system, we show how our framework can be practically applied. 2017 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increase of reported security incidents hitting large software systems. Such incidents can originate from different attackers exploiting vulnerabilities of different parts of a system. Hence, there is a need for enhancing security considerations in software development. It is crucial for requirements engineers to identify security threats early on, and to refine the threats into security requirements. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for Problem-based Security Requirements Elicitation (PresSuRE). PresSuRE is a method for identifying security needs during the requirements analysis of software systems using a problem frame model. Our method does not rely entirely on the requirements engineer to detect security needs, but provides a computer-aided security threat identification, and subsequently the elicitation of security requirements. The identification is based on the functional requirements for a system-to-be. We illustrate and validate our approach using a smart grid scenario provided by the industrial partners of the EU project NESSoS. Copyright 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.",

Existing deception approaches are included in the software development process in an ad-hoc fashion, and are fundamentally realized as single tools or entire solutions repackaged as honeypot machines. We propose a systematic goal-driven approach to include deception tactics early in the software development process so that conflicts and risks can be found in the initial phases of the development, reducing costs of ill-planed decisions. The process integrates three phases: system modeling (producing a goal model of the application domain), security modeling (producing a threat model specifying the typical security concerns from the attacker perspective), and deception modeling (producing a deception tactic model, a variability model, and deception story models). The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown via a case study where deception defense strategies are designed for a students' presence control system for our University. \\\\textcopyright 2016 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Security has been a growing concern for large organizations, especially financial and governmental institutions, as security breaches in the systems they depend on have repeatedly resulted in billions of dollars in losses per year, and this cost is on the rise. A primary reason for these breaches is that the systems in question are \u201csocio-technical\u201d a mix of people, processes, technology, and infrastructure. However, such systems are designed in a piecemeal rather than a holistic fashion, leaving parts of the system vulnerable. To tackle this problem, we propose a three-layer security analysis framework consisting of a social layer (business processes, social actors), a software layer (software applications that support the social layer), and an infrastructure layer (physical and technological infrastructure). In our proposal, global security requirements lead to local security requirements, cutting across conceptual layers, and upper-layer security analysis influences analysis at lower layers. Moreover, we propose a set of analytical methods and a systematic process that together drive security requirements analysis across the three layers. To support analysis, we have defined corresponding inference rules that (semi-)automate the analysis, helping to deal with system complexity. A prototype tool has been implemented to support analysts throughout the analysis process. Moreover, we have performed a case study on a real-world smart grid scenario to validate our approach.",

        "abstract": "Policy design is an important part of software development. As security breaches increase in variety, designing a security policy that addresses all potential breaches becomes a nontrivial task. A complete security policy would specify rules to prevent breaches. Systematically determining which, if any, policy clause has been violated by a reported breach is a means for identifying gaps in a policy. Our research goal is to help analysts measure the gaps between security policies and reported breaches by developing a systematic process based on semantic reasoning. We propose SEMAVER, a framework for determining coverage of breaches by policies via comparison of individual policy clauses and breach descriptions. We represent a security policy as a set of norms. Norms (commitments, authorizations, and prohibitions) describe expected behaviors of users, and formalize who is accountable to whom and for what. A breach corresponds to a norm violation. We develop a semantic similarity metric for pairwise comparison between the norm that represents a policy clause and the norm that has been violated by a reported breach. We use the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a case study. Our investigation of a subset of the breaches reported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reveals the gaps between HIPAA and reported breaches, leading to a coverage of 65\\\\%. Additionally, our classification of the 1,577 HHS breaches shows that 44\\\\% of the breaches are accidental misuses and 56\\\\% are malicious misuses. We find that HIPAA's gaps regarding accidental misuses are significantly larger than its gaps regarding malicious misuses. 2017 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The development of secure software systems is an increasingly important research topic in software engineering. Several authors have proposed methods, techniques and tools to software development practices in order to identify and/or mitigate security threats. These methods and techniques are based in traditional software engineering artifacts, such as Use Cases, Activity Diagrams and Domain Models. However, the lack of scientific evidence of the quality or efficiency of these methods, leads us to question if this approach is necessary for software security experts. This article proposes an experimental approach to explore if software development artifacts are relevant when making security decisions in software development, and how are they used. We have designed a survey in order to ask these questions to software security and architecture experts. We used the Constant Comparison Method in order to find emerging security theories about software artifacts, grounded in the answers of the experts. Our results add experimental evidence into the use and usefullness of software development artifacts in helping to reduce security vulnerabilities in practice, from the experts point of view. Our results add experimental evidence into the use and usefulness of software development artifacts to evaluate the security from the point of view of the experts. Our evidence suggests that not all software artifacts are equally useful in the design of secure architectures, considering the \"Use Cases\" and \"Class Diagrams\" as the most useful artifacts according to our respondents. Also, our evidence suggest that experts do not agree in the importance of analyzing security concerns through the whole software life cycle, nor in the abstraction level required for this task. 2015 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Identifying security requirements early on can lay the foundation for secure software development. Security requirements are often implied by existing functional requirements but are mostly left unspecified. The Security Discoverer (SD) process automatically identifies security implications of individual requirements sentences and suggests applicable security requirements templates. The objective of this research is to support requirements analysts in identifying security requirements by automating the suggestion of security requirements templates that are implied by existing functional requirements. We conducted a controlled experiment in a graduate-level security class at North Carolina State University (NCSU) to evaluate the SD process in eliciting implied security requirements in 2014. We have subsequently conducted three differentiated replications to evaluate the generalizability and applicability of the initial findings. The replications were conducted across three countries at the University of Trento, NCSU, and the University of Costa Rica. We evaluated the responses of the 205 total participants in terms of quality, coverage, relevance and efficiency. We also develop shared insights regarding the impact of context factors such as time, motivation and support, on the study outcomes and provide lessons learned in conducting the replications. Treatment group, using the SD process, performed significantly better than the control group (at p-value \\\\textless0.05) in terms of the coverage of the identified security requirements and efficiency of the requirements elicitation process in two of the three replications, supporting the findings of the original study. Participants in the treatment group identified 84 \\\\% more security requirements in the oracle as compared to the control group on average. Overall, 80 \\\\% of the 111 participants in the treatment group were favorable towards the use of templates in identifying security requirements. Our qualitative findings indicate that participants may be able to differentiate between relevant and extraneous templates suggestions and be more inclined to fill in the templates with additional support. Security requirements templates capture the security knowledge of multiple experts and can support the security requirements elicitation process when automatically suggested, making the implied security requirements more evident. However, individual participants may still miss out on identifying a number of security requirements due to empirical constraints as well as potential limitations on knowledge and security expertise. 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Furthermore, supporting the proper testing of these systems can often times prove complicated. Within trustworthiness, security and privacy play key roles. Considering both security and privacy issues early in development are necessary to increase the trustworthiness of systems. In this paper we concentrate on the security aspect of trustworthiness. We believe that proper capture of software security starts at requirements and carries forward throughout system development, especially into testing. While a variety of techniques for specifying security requirements exist, there is a tangible lack of support for making security requirements useful during testing. In this paper we present testing capabilities of a new security requirements engineering technique called SURE, Secure and Usable Requirements Engineering. SURE focuses on the mapping of security requirements into testing artifacts using a specialized syntax. We also present results from a usability study of our technique's testing capabilities; the study confirmed that participants were able to map testing artifacts from security requirements with increased understanding and confidence, which could potentially lead to improved trustworthiness. 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In recent years critical infrastructures have witnessed rapid developments in the way their services are being implemented and delivered to consumers; this was instigated by the adaptation of the latest technologies in IT. An example of such an infrastructure is smart metering in the energy sector. Despite the evident advantages of such transformation, this lead to the emergence of new challenges facing these infrastructures, such as preserving the security of the information of these systems. Common security implementation practices involve retrofitting security measures into the system rather than incorporating it in early stages of system development life cycle. In this paper we give a brief overview of the consequences resulting from information security breaches, in addition to presenting the main causes behind addressing information security as an after-thought in an ad-hoc manner. 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Many techniques have been proposed for eliciting software security requirements during the early requirements engineering phase. However, few techniques so far provide dedicated views of security issues in a software systems architecture context. This is a problem, because almost all requirements work today happens in a given architectural context, and understanding this architecture is vital for identifying security vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigations. Misuse case maps attempt to provide an integrated view of security and architecture by augmenting use case maps with misuse case concepts. This paper evaluates misuse case maps through two controlled experiments where 33 and 54 ICT students worked on complex real-life intrusions described in the literature. The students who used misuse case maps showed significantly better understanding of intrusions and better ability to suggest mitigations than students who used a combination of two existing techniques as an alternative treatment. Misuse case maps were also perceived more favourably overall than the alternative treatment, and participants reported using misuse case maps more when solving their tasks.",

The paper highlights the connections and differences we found across different domains and proposals.

        "abstract": "Security requirements are concerned with protecting assets of a system from harm. Implemented as code aspects to weave protection mechanisms into the system, security requirements need to be validated when changes are made to the programs during system evolution. However, it was not clear for developers whether existing validation procedures such as test cases are sufficient for security and when the implemented aspects need to adapt. In this chapter, we propose an approach for detecting any change to the satisfaction of security requirements in three steps: (1) identify the asset variables in the systems that are only accessed by a join-point method, (2) trace these asset variables to identify both control and data dependencies between the non-aspect and aspect functions and (3) update the test cases according to implementation of these dependencies to strengthen the protection when a change happens. These steps are illustrated by a case study of a meeting scheduling system where security is a critical concern. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013. All rights are reserved.",

On the other hand, the SE community has developed sound methods to elicit functional requirements in the early stages, but usability has been relegated to the last stages together with other non-functional requirements. Therefore, there are no methods of usability requirements elicitation to develop software within both communities. An example of this problem arises if we focus on the Model-Driven Development paradigm, where the methods and tools that are used to develop software do not support usability requirements elicitation.

        "abstract": "Context In many organizational environments critical tasks exist which - in exceptional cases such as an emergency - must be performed by a subject although he/she is usually not authorized to perform these tasks. Break-glass policies have been introduced as a sophisticated exception handling mechanism to resolve such situations. They enable certain subjects to break or override the standard access control policies of an information system in a controlled manner. Objective In the context of business process modeling a number of approaches exist that allow for the formal specification and modeling of process-related access control concepts. However, corresponding support for break-glass policies is still missing. In this paper, we aim at specifying a break-glass extension for process-related role-based access control (RBAC) models. Method We use model-driven development (MDD) techniques to provide an integrated, tool-supported approach for the definition and enforcement of break-glass policies in process-aware information systems. In particular, we provide modeling support on the computation independent model (CIM) layer as well as on the platform independent model (PIM) and platform specific model (PSM) layers. Results Our approach is generic in the sense that it can be used to extend process-aware information systems or process modeling languages with support for process-related RBAC and corresponding break-glass policies. Based on the formal CIM layer metamodel, we present a UML extension on the PIM layer that allows for the integrated modeling of processes and process-related break-glass policies via extended UML Activity diagrams. We evaluated our approach in a case study on real-world processes. Moreover, we implemented our approach at the PSM layer as an extension to the BusinessActivity library and runtime engine. Conclusion Our integrated modeling approach for process-related break-glass policies allows for specifying break-glass rules in process-aware information systems. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Software-intensive and networked embedded systems implement more and more security critical tasks. The following paper presents a framework to support security analysis along the design process using virtual prototypes (VPs). VPs describe the interconnection between different system components, include actual application codes and even integrate existing physical prototypes. These enable the user to detect structural security flaws, implementation flaws and even hardware-based security problems. Benefits of using VPs are the early availability in the design process and the fact that VPs are based on software, therefore established security analysis methods for software can be applied. This paper provides a methodology and tooling support to apply VP in the context of security analyses. Especially the integration in a model-driven design (MDD) process is highlighted. A proposed security UML profile as well as code generation ease the VP-based analysis. Copyright 2018 by SCITEPRESS \u2013 Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.",

Privacy regulations protect our right to have the control on our personal data. According to the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), entered into force in May 2018, infringements can be very costly to organizations, ranging from 10s to 100s of thousands of Euros. In order to ensure compliance with such regulations, privacy should be taken into consideration as early as at requirements time, so to avoid expensive after-the-fact fixes. Modeling frameworks have been proposed to support the analysis of requirements in complex socio-technical systems, however, even if a primary role is given to security, for privacy more work need to be done. In this paper, starting from the social concept of consent, we propose a modeling language and define the formal framework for the analysis of privacy-consent requirements.

        "abstract": "Context: Modern internet-based services, ranging from food-delivery to home-caring, leverage the availability of multiple programmable devices to provide handy services tailored to end-user needs. These services are delivered through an ecosystem of device-specific software components and interfaces (e.g., mobile and wearable device applications). Since they often handle private information (e.g., location and health status), their security and privacy requirements are of crucial importance. Defining and analyzing those requirements is a significant challenge due to the multiple types of software components and devices integrated into software ecosystems. Each software component presents peculiarities that often depend on the context and the devices the component interact with, and that must be considered when dealing with security and privacy requirements. Objective: In this paper, we propose, apply, and assess a modeling method that supports the specification of security and privacy requirements in a structured and analyzable form. Our motivation is that, in many contexts, use cases are common practice for the elicitation of functional requirements and should also be adapted for describing security requirements. Method: We integrate an existing approach for modeling security and privacy requirements in terms of security threats, their mitigations, and their relations to use cases in a misuse case diagram. We introduce new security-related templates, i.e., a mitigation template and a misuse case template for specifying mitigation schemes and misuse case specifications in a structured and analyzable manner. Natural language processing can then be used to automatically report inconsistencies among artifacts and between the templates and specifications. Results: We successfully applied our approach to an industrial healthcare project and report lessons learned and results from structured interviews with engineers. Conclusion: Since our approach supports the precise specification and analysis of security threats, threat scenarios and their mitigations, it also supports decision making and the analysis of compliance to standards",

        "abstract": "The elicitation of security requirements is a crucial issue to develop secure business processes and information systems of higher quality. Although we have several methods to elicit security requirements, most of them do not provide sufficient supports to identify security threats. Since threats do not occur so frequently, like exceptional events, it is much more difficult to determine the potentials of threats exhaustively rather than identifying normal behavior of a business process. To reduce this difficulty, accumulated knowledge of threats obtained from practical setting is necessary. In this paper, we present the technique to model knowledge of threats as patterns by deriving the negative scenarios that realize threats and to utilize them during business process modeling. The knowledge is extracted from Security Target documents, based on the international Common Criteria Standard, and the patterns are described with transformation rules on sequence diagrams. In our approach, an analyst composes normal scenarios of a business process with sequence diagrams, and the threat patterns matched to them derives negative scenarios. Our approach has been demonstrated on several examples, to show its practical application. \\\\textcopyright 2013 IEEE.",

In particular, a delegation extension for process-related role-based access control (RBAC) models is specified. The extension is generic in the sense that it can be used to extend process-aware information systems or process modeling languages with support for process-related RBAC delegation models. Moreover, the detection of delegation-related conflicts is discussed and a set of pre-defined resolution strategies for each potential conflict is provided. Thereby, the design-time and runtime consistency of corresponding RBAC delegation models can be ensured. Based on a formal metamodel, UML2 modeling support for the delegation of roles, tasks, and duties is provided. A corresponding case study evaluates the practical applicability of the approach with real-world business processes. Moreover, the approach is implemented as an extension to the BusinessActivity library and runtime engine. 2014 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.",

In this paper, we present a Unified Modelling Language profile, named SecAM, that enables the modelling and security specification for critical infrastructures during the early phases (requirements, design) of system development life cycle. SecAM enables security assessment, through survivability analysis, of different security solutions before system deployment.

The authors advanced the state-of-the-art by developing and applying the method to ISO 27002 information security controls and by developing a semantic decision support system. Design/methodology/approach: The research has been conducted under design science principles. The formalized information security controls were used in a compliance/risk management decision support system which has been evaluated with experts and end-users in real-world environments. Findings: There are different ways of obtaining compliance to information security standards. For example, by implementing countermeasures of different quality depending on the protection needs of the organization. The authors developed decision support mechanisms which use the formal control descriptions as input to support the decision-maker at identifying the most appropriate countermeasure strategy based on cost and risk reduction potential. Originality/value: Formalizing and mapping the ISO 27002 controls to the security ontology enabled the authors to automatically determine the compliance status and organization-wide risk-level based on the formal control descriptions and the modelled environment, including organizational structures, IT infrastructure, available countermeasures, etc. Furthermore, it allowed them to automatically determine which countermeasures are missing to ensure compliance and to decrease the risk to an acceptable level. \\\\textcopyright 2018, Stefan Fenz and Thomas Neubauer.",

We adopted security requirements engineering methods to identify security requirements at the early stages of software development life cycle so as to minimize vulnerabilities at the later phases. In this paper, we present the evaluation of Model Oriented Security Requirements Engineering (MOSRE) framework and Security Requirements Engineering Framework (SREF) by implementing the identified security requirements of a web application through each framework while developing respective web application. We also developed a web application without using any of the security requirements engineering method in order to prove the importance of security requirements engineering phase in software development life cycle. The developed web applications were scanned for vulnerabilities using the web application scanning tool. The evaluation was done in two phases of software development life cycle: requirements engineering and testing. From the results, we observed that the number of vulnerabilities detected in the web application developed by adopting MOSRE framework is less, when compared to the web applications developed adopting SREF and without using any security requirements engineering method. Thus, this study led the requirements engineers to use MOSRE framework to elicit security requirements efficiently and also trace security requirements from requirements engineering phase to later phases of software development life cycle for developing secure web applications. 2018, Zarka Private University.

        "abstract": "Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme. 2012 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems (CPS) that support complex collaborative business processes is an emergent property. New technologies like cloud computing bring new capabilities for hosting and offering complex collaborative business operations. However, these advances might introduce new vulnerabilities and threats caused by collaboration and data exchange over the Internet. Hence, users become more concerned about trust. In order to address users' trust concerns, trustworthiness requirements for the CPS must be elicited and satisfied. They describe the properties (qualities) the CPS must possess in order to be trustworthy. In this paper, we suggest a problem-based requirements engineering method that supports specifically the derivation of trustworthiness requirements. Based on identified trust concerns of users, trust assumptions are made explicit in problem diagrams. They express the conditions under which users are willing to trust. The problem diagrams and trust assumptions are then refined until they are concrete enough to derive trustworthiness requirements from them. During the refinement process, trust assumptions may influence and modify the system design (and vice versa, i.e., due to a certain system design, new trust concerns may arise that need to be addressed). In this way, users' trust concerns are considered right from the beginning and trustworthiness is designed into the CPS. An application example from the healthcare domain is used to demonstrate our approach. 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Recently published reports on cybercrime indicate an everincreasing number of security incidents related to IT systems. Many attacks causing the incidents abuse (in)directly one or more security defects. Fixing the security defect once fielded is costly. To avoid the defects and the subsequent need to fix them, security has to be considered thoroughly when developing software. The earliest phase to do so is the requirements engineering, in which security threats should be identified early on and treated by defining sufficient security requirements. In a previous paper [1], we introduced a methodology for Problem-based Security Requirements Elicitation (PresSuRE). PresSuRE provides a computeraided security threat identification. The identification is based on the functional requirements for a system-to-be. Still, there is a need for guidance on how to derive security requirements once the threats are identified. In this work, we provide such guidance extending PresSuRE and its tool support. We illustrate and validate our approach using a smart grid scenario provided by the industrial partners of the EU project NESSoS. Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",

        "abstract": "SOPL approach (Service Oriented Product Line) can be used in various domains where SOA based applications are needed such as e/m government, e-business, e-learning and so on. This approach is a combination of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and product line. SOA offers a solution to problems of integration and interoperability between services. But the SOA approach doesn't follow a specific reuse approach. In Product Line approach, reuse is systematic with two phases domain engineering and application engineering and offers mechanisms for the management of the variability. Ensure secure services are vital in order to establish trust between users and service providers. In this context, we aim to extend SOPL phases with security activities in order to produce secure service-oriented applications and for such activity we indicate means (methods, tools, etc.) that that allow us to perform security activities that we have introduced. In this work, we propose Secure SOPL: a development process that integrates security in the SOPL process. The originality of our work is on the integration of security in SOPL. Notes that existing works are either oriented to the integration of security in classical development processes or they are oriented enrichment of SPL by security activities but not treat the SOPL approach. 2015 IEEE.",

Requirements engineering education (REE) is therefore an important undertaking if the field is to have professionals who are capable of successfully accomplishing software projects. This increasing interest demands that academia should provide software engineering students with a solid foundation in the subject matter. This paper aims to identify and to present the current research on REE that is available at present, and to select useful approaches and needs for future research. A systematic mapping study was therefore performed to classify the selected studies into five classification criteria: research type, empirical type, contribution type, RE activity, and curricula. A total of 79 papers were selected and classified according to these criteria. The results of this systematic mapping study are discussed, and a list of advice obtained from the REE literature for instructors is provided. \\\\textcopyright 2013, Springer-Verlag London.",

        "abstract": "Security is a concern that must be taken into consideration starting from the early stages of system development. Over the last two decades, researchers and engineers have developed a considerable number of methods for security requirements engineering. Some of them rely on the (re)use of security knowledge. Despite some existing surveys about security requirements engineering, there is not yet any reference for researchers and practitioners that presents in a systematic way the existing proposals, techniques, and tools related to security knowledge reuse in security requirements engineering. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by looking into drawing a picture of the literature on knowledge and reuse in security requirements engineering. The questions we address are related to methods, techniques, modeling frameworks, and tools for and by reuse in security requirements engineering. We address these questions through a systematic mapping study. The mapping study was a literature review conducted with the goal of identifying, analyzing, and categorizing state-of-the-art research on our topic. This mapping study analyzes more than thirty approaches, covering 20 years of research in security requirements engineering. The contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) A framework was defined for analyzing and comparing the different proposals as well as categorizing future contributions related to knowledge reuse and security requirements engineering; (2) the different forms of knowledge representation and reuse were identified; and (3) previous surveys were updated. We conclude that most methods should introduce more reusable knowledge to manage security requirements. \\\\textcopyright 2015, Springer-Verlag London.",

Likewise, it is important that the development process used integrates security aspects from the first stages at the same level as other functional and non-functional requirements. In the last years, GRID technology has shown to be the most important one and it allows us to build very complex information systems with different and remarkable features (interoperability between multiple security domains, cross-domain authentication and authorization, dynamic, heterogeneous and limited mobile devices, etc). Traditionally, systems based on GRID Computing have not been developed through adequate methodologies and have not taken into account security requirements throughout their development, only offering security technical solutions at the implementation stages. This paper shows part of a development methodology that we are elaborating for the construction of information systems based on Grid Computing highly dependent on mobile devices where security plays a very important role. Specifically, in this paper, we will present the analysis phase, managed by reusable use cases through which we can define the requirements and needs of these systems obtaining an analysis model that can be used as input to the following phase of the methodology, the design phase of mobile Grid systems. 2009 IEEE.",

It is also expected that this will increase the quality of services by providing services round-the-clock and will support independent living of the elderly. However, IT-based care systems can also introduce new types of risks such as those related to availability and accountability. This can possibly lead to a decline of using such expensive IT-based homecare systems in practice. In order to prevent this, we propose a method to identify potential risks of using such a system, and to specify additional requirements of the system to mitigate or prevent these risks. We validate the usability and potential utility of our approach by three experiments using a case from the homecare domain.

        "abstract": "Purpose The selection of security configurations for complex information systems is a cumbersome process. Decision-making regarding the choice of security countermeasures has to take into consideration a multitude of, often conflicting, functional and non-functional system goals. Therefore, a structured method to support crucial security decisions during a system's design that can take account of risk whilst providing feedback on the optimal decisions within specific scenarios would be valuable. Design/methodology/approach Secure Tropos is a well-established security requirements engineering methodology, but it has no concepts of Risk, whilst Constrained Goal Models are an existing method to support relevant automated reasoning tasks. Hence we bridge these methods, by extending Secure Tropos to incorporate the concept of Risk, so that the elicitation and analysis of security requirements can be complimented by a systematic risk assessment process during a system's design time and supporting the reasoning regarding the selection of optimal security configurations with respect to multiple system objectives and constraints, via constrained goal models. Findings As a means of conceptual evaluation, to give an idea of the applicability of the approach and to check if alterations may be desirable, a case study of its application to an e-government information system is presented. The proposed approach is able to generate security mechanism configurations for multiple optimisation scenarios that are provided, whilst there are limitations in terms of a natural trade-off of information levels of risk assessment that are required to be elicited. Originality/value The proposed approach adds additional value via its flexibility in permitting the consideration of different optimisation scenarios by prioritising different system goals and the automated reasoning support.",

        "abstract": "Popular software applications collect and retain a lot of users' information, part of which is personal and sensitive. To assure that only the desired information is made public, these applications have to define and publish privacy policies that describe how they manage and disclose this information. Problems arise when privacy policies are misinterpreted, for instance because they contain ambiguous and inconsistent statements, what results in a defective application of the policy enforcement mechanisms. The RSLingo4Privacy approach aims to improve the specification and analysis of such policies. This paper presents and discusses its companion tool, the RSLingo4Privacy Studio, which materializes this approach by providing the technological support for users being able to specify, analyze and publish policies based on the RSL-IL4Privacy domain specific language. We validated its feasibility using popular websites policies such as Dropbox, Facebook, IMDB, LinkedIn, Twitter and Zynga.

        "abstract": "Business processes have become important resources, both for an enterprise's performance and to enable it to maintain its competitiveness. The languages used for business process representation have, in recent years, been improved and new notations have appeared. However, despite the wide acceptance of the importance of business process security, to date the business analyst perspective in relation to security has hardly been dealt with. Moreover, security requirements cannot be represented in modern business process modeling notations. In this paper, we present an extension of UML 2.0 activity diagrams which will allow security requirements to be specified in business processes. Our proposal, denominated as BPSec (Business Process Security), is Model Driven Architecture compliant since it is possible to obtain a set of UML artifacts (Platform Independent Model-PIM) used in software development from a Secure Business Process model specification (Computation Independent Model-CIM). We also present the application of our approach to an example based on a typical health care institution, in which our M-BPSec method is employed as a framework for the use of our UML extension. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Discovering potential attacks on a system is an essential step in engineering secure systems, as the identified attacks will determine essential security requirements. The prevalence of Socio-Technical Systems (STSs) makes attack analysis particularly challenging. These systems are composed of people and organizations, their software systems, as well as physical infrastructures. As such, a thorough attack analysis needs to consider strategic (social and organizational) aspects of the involved people and organizations, as well as technical aspects affecting software systems and the physical infrastructure, requiring a large amount of security knowledge which is difficult to acquire. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to efficiently leverage a comprehensive attack knowledge repository (CAPEC) in order to identify realistic and detailed attack behaviors, avoiding severe repercussions of security breaches. In particular, we propose a systematic method to model CAPEC attack patterns, which has been applied to 102 patterns, in order to semi-automatically select and apply such patterns. Using the CAPEC patterns as part of a systematic and tool-supported process, we can efficiently operationalize attack strategies and identify realistic alternative attacks on an STS. We validate our proposal by performing a case study on a smart grid scenario. 2016 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) is concerned with detect- ing and analysing security issues early in the software development process. Some variants of i; start since early requirements and rely on modelling actors and their dependencies. Though useful for traditional information systems devel- opment, these approaches adopt a bird's eye perspective that is inadequate for service-oriented applications, in which multiple autonomous and heterogeneous agents interact to achieve their own strategic interests. In this paper we present SecCo (Security via Commitments), a novel SRE frame- work expressly thought for service-oriented settings. The key intuition is to relate security requirements to interaction. In order to do so, we specify security re- quirements in terms of social commitments, promises with contractual validity between agents. These commitments describe the security properties the service provider commits to ensure to the consumer while delivering the service.",

        "abstract": "Currently many software companies attempt the integration of agile project delivery models and security requirements engineering (RE). However, very little is published on how this is achieved in real-life settings. This paper reports on results from a documentary study initiated to understand the agile-ready security practices that organizations use. We selected seven well-documented Security RE frameworks for Agile projects that have been used in practice and carried out a qualitative thematic analysis based on documents describing the frameworks and their supposed use in detail. This resulted in a list of solution practices that focus on introducing artefacts, organizational roles, competencies and activities in order to make sure that security RE is done systematically in agile project organizations. Our conclusion is that Security RE adds up to the documentation in an agile project, as teams introduce new story types, e.g. evil user stories, abuser stories, security stories. Plus, we found that Security RE relies on investments into the security training of the agile project teams and into organizing hack sessions. Last, if companies take security requirements seriously, it seems that they should consider ignoring the gatekeeping role of the agile product owner.",

        "abstract": "Security is a focus in many systems that are developed today, yet this aspect of systems development is often relegated when the shipping date for a software product looms. This leads to problems post-implementation in terms of patches required to fix security defects or vulnerabilities. A simplistic answer is that if the code was correct in the first instance, then vulnerabilities would not exist. The reality of a complex software artefact is however, driven by other concerns. Rather than probing programs for coding errors that lead to vulnerabilities, it is perhaps more beneficial to look at the root causes of how and why vulnerabilities come to exist in software. This paper explores the reasons why this might be so, uses two simple case studies to illustrate the effects of failing to specify requirements correctly and suggests that software development methods that build in security concerns at the beginning of a project might be the way forward. \\\\textcopyright 2009 Michael N.

Much research has focused on this field in recent years, spurred by the realization that security must be dealt with in the earliest phases of the software development process as these phases cover a broader organizational perspective. Agent-oriented methodologies have proved to be especially useful in this setting as they support the modeling of the social context in which the system-to-be will operate. In our previous work, we proposed the SI*modeling language to deal with security and trust, and the Secure Tropos methodology for designing secure software systems. Since then, both have been revised and refined in light of experience gained from their application to several industry case studies. This chapter presents the consolidated versions of the SI*modeling language and the Secure Tropos methodology and recounts our experiences, explaining the practical and theoretical reasons behind each consolidation step. 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

But there is a huge gap between security requirements expressed with human language and formal security properties that can be verified. This paper presents the use of OCL to formalize security requirements in a model-driven approach for security-critical applications. SecureMDD is such a model-driven approach. It uses UML to model the application and OCL to specify the security requirements. From the application model and the contained OCL constraints, a formal specification of the application including the security properties is generated automatically. This specification is used to verify application-specific security properties that matches a lot of security requirements much better than application-independent security properties like secrecy, integrity and confidentiality. We demonstrate how to concretize security requirements as well as the use of OCL constraints to specify security requirements, the transformation from OCL constraints into algebraic specifications and the use of those specifications to verify the security requirements using an electronic ticketing system as a case study. 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The design of an authorization infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of engineering a secure software system. Unlike other system types, distributed systems - and especially distributed collaborative systems - can require custom, fine-grained authorization models and enforcement approaches that are able to take into account a range of semantic subtleties. In this paper we present a comprehensive, pattern-oriented software engineering approach to authorization for general distributed systems - with particular applicability to distributed collaborative systems - that allows developers to build custom, application-specific conceptual authorization models in a simple yet extensible manner, and to make informed decisions regarding their enforcement in software, as well as how their supporting rule/policy infrastructure should be designed. Our authorization approach is embodied in two instances of a new pattern-based security engineering construct called a security solution frame, which groups together related patterns - both security \"product\" and micro-process patterns - in different sub-structures, horizontally and vertically, for a single high-level security policy (in our case authorization and policy management). By applying specific micro-process patterns in each solution frame, developers are guided in using relevant \"product\" patterns to progressively construct a distributed authorization infrastructure - from abstract concepts toward concrete designs, via a number of levels of abstraction implying solution refinement and corresponding to stages of the development life-cycle. The summary-form \"product\" patterns encapsulated in each frame also help developers to form a holistic, \"global\" view when analyzing existing infrastructures. We illustrate and evaluate the proposal in the context of greenfield system development by applying our solution frames to design the authorization infrastructure of a (new) distributed system for secure file sharing and collaborative editing; and also use our solution frames to briefly analyze and capture the design decisions underlying two existing distributed authorization infrastructures: one based on UCON for collaborative Grid systems and another based on ZBAC for SOA-based systems.",

        "abstract": "Companies and government organizations are increasingly compelled, if not required by law, to ensure that their information systems will comply with various federal and industry regulatory standards, such as the NIST Special Publication on Security Controls for Federal Information Systems (NIST SP-800-53), or the Common Criteria (ISO 15408-2). Such organizations operate business or mission critical systems where a lack of or lapse in security protections translates to serious confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks that, if exploited, could result in information disclosure, loss of money, or, at worst, loss of life. To mitigate these risks and ensure that their information systems meet regulatory standards, organizations must be able to (a) contextualize regulatory documents in a way that extracts the relevant technical implications for their systems, (b) formally represent their systems and demonstrate that they meet the extracted requirements following an accreditation process, and (c) ensure that all third-party systems, which may exist outside of the information system enclave as web or cloud services also implement appropriate security measures consistent with organizational expectations. This paper introduces a step-wise process, based on semantic hierarchies, that systematically extracts relevant security requirements from control standards to build a certification baseline for organizations to use in conjunction with formal methods and service agreements for accreditation. The approach is demonstrated following a case study of all audit-related controls in the SP-800-53, ISO 15408-2, and related documents. Accuracy, applicability, consistency, and efficacy of the approach were evaluated using controlled qualitative and quantitative methods in two separate studies. \\\\textcopyright 2017 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "Since Gamma et al. published their design patterns, patterns are very popular in the area of software engineering. They provide best practice to handle recurring problems during the software development phase. Three years later, security patterns appeared and provided solutions for security problems. Besides the name analogy, design and security patterns should be very similar except for the security factor. In research and industry software engineering with design patterns is widespread. However, some researchers suspect that security-pattern engineering is made difficult by some issues such as terminology or description form. Detecting adoption problems can help to improve security patterns in future. Thus, they can promote the awareness of security especially in the software maintenance phase where many programmers first give attention to security problems. Therefore, we will compare design and security patterns to find indicators for negative impact on security pattern engineering in software development. We address this issue on inspecting the aspects classification, description form, provided code examples, and usage in the software life-cycle. We determine the degree of maturity of software-security patterns by comparing them to the well-explored design patterns. To achieve the objective, we inspect the pattern terminology and conducted a study on the used description forms including provided UML diagrams and code examples. Moreover, a literature review is conducted to compare their state of research w.r.t. the software life-cycle. The maturity degree of security patterns compared to common design patterns differs and we depict further research opportunities on security patterns.",

        "abstract": "Model-based systems engineering provides a multi-disciplinary approach to developing cyber-physical systems. Due to their high degree of interconnection, security is a key factor for cyber-physical systems and needs to be front-loaded to the beginning of the development. However, there is a lack of model-based systems engineering approaches that enable the early specification of security policies. As a consequence, security requirements frequently remain unspecified and therefore are hard to satisfy in the downstream development phases. In this paper, we propose to integrate model-based systems engineering with the theory of information flow security. We extend systems engineering models to information flow policies, enabling systems engineers to specify the information flow security requirements of a system under development. On refinement of the resulting models, our approach allows to derive security requirements for individual software components. We illustrate our approach using a model-based design of an autonomous car. Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",

        "abstract": "Software developers are often interested in particular changes in programs that are relevant to their current tasks: not all changes to evolving software are equally important. However, most existing differencing tools, such as diff, notify developers of more changes than they wish to see. In this paper, we propose a technique to specify and automatically detect only those changes in programs deemed meaningful, or relevant, to a particular development task. Using four elementary annotations on the grammar of any programming language, namely Ignore, Order, Prefer and Scope, developers can specify, with limited effort, the type of change they wish to detect. Our algorithms use these annotations to transform the input programs into a normalised form, and to remove clones across different normalised programs in order to detect non-trivial and relevant differences. We evaluate our tool on a benchmark of programs to demonstrate its improved precision compared to other differencing approaches. 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Pervasive computing is a research field of computing technology that aims to achieve a new computing paradigm. In this paradigm, the physical environment has a high degree of pervasiveness and availability of computers and other information technology (IT) devices, usually with communication capabilities. Pervasive Information Systems (PIS), composed by these kinds of devices, bring issues that challenge software development for them. Model-Driven Development (MDD), strongly focusing and relying on models, has the potential to allow: the use of concepts closer to the domain and the reduction of semantic gaps; higher automation and lower dependency to technological changes; higher capture of expert knowledge and reuse; an overall increased productivity. Along with the focus and use of models, software development processes are fundamental to efficient development efforts of successful software systems. For the description of processes, Software \\\\& Systems Process Engineering Meta-Model Specification (SPEM) is the current standard specification published by the Object Management Group (OMG). This paper presents an extension to SPEM (version 2.0) Base Plug-In Profile that includes stereotypes needed to support a suitable structural process organization for MDD approaches aiming to develop software for PIS.

        "abstract": "Software security is a matter of major concern for software development enterprises that wish to deliver highly secure software products to their customers. Static analysis is considered one of the most effective mechanisms for adding security to software products. The multitude of static analysis tools that are available provide a large number of raw results that may contain security-relevant information, which may be useful for the production of secure software. Several mechanisms that can facilitate the production of both secure and reliable software applications have been proposed over the years. In this paper, two such mechanisms, particularly the vulnerability prediction models (VPMs) and the optimum checkpoint recommendation (OCR) mechanisms, are theoretically examined, while their potential improvement by using static analysis is also investigated. In particular, we review the most significant contributions regarding these mechanisms, identify their most important open issues, and propose directions for future research, emphasizing on the potential adoption of static analysis for addressing the identified open issues. Hence, this paper can act as a reference for researchers that wish to contribute in these subfields, in order to gain solid understanding of the existing solutions and their open issues that require further research. 2018, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Security standards, e.g., the Common Criteria (ISO 15408), are applied by software vendors to establish a level of confidence that the security functionality of their products and their applied assurance measures are sufficient. To get a Common Criteria certification, a comprehensible set of documents is necessary, including a detailed threat analysis and security objective elicitation. We focus on improving the Common Criteria threat analysis and the derivation of security objectives in our work. Our method is based upon an attacker model, which considers different attacker types, e.g., software attackers, that threaten only specific parts of a system. We provide tool support for checking the consistency and the completeness of the specified software systems using OCL expressions. For example, we check if all types of attackers have been considered for a specific domain, we check for all software domains that either a software attacker is considered or an assumption is documented that excludes software attackers, and we check if all threats are addressed by security objectives. Moreover, we can generate tables and texts from our UML models to satisfy the Common Criteria documentation demands. For instance, we can generate Common Criteria specific cross-table, which maps every security objective and assumption to a specific threat. The consistency checks are integrated in our structured method for threat analysis that considers the Common Criteria's (CC) demands for documentation of the system in its environment and the reasoning that all threats are discovered and addressed. With our support tool UML4PF (that extends a UML tool and contains e.g., a UML profile and an OCL validator), we support security reasoning, validation of models, and we are able to generate Common Criteria-compliant documentation using model-to-text transformations. Our threat analysis method can also be used for threat analysis without the common criteria, because it uses a specific part of the UML profile that can be adapted to other demands with little effort. For example, it could be adapted for other security standards like ISO 27001. We illustrate our approach with the development of a smart metering gateway system.",

According to cloud security alliance (CSA), privacy level agreements (PLAs) are intended to be used as appendixes to service level agreements and are likely to become as an industry standardized way for cloud service providers to describe the level of privacy and data protection. In this paper, we introduce an approach to verify whether the system design of a service provider supports the service customer's privacy and security preferences, by exploiting PLAs. In the first step, we formalize the PLAs. To this end, a metamodel for the PLAs is provided. This metamodel is based on the PLA outline provided by CSA, which is originally based on Directive 95/46/EC. In our research, we first investigate if an adaptation of the PLA outline with respect to the Regulation 2016/679 (repealing of Directive 95/46/EC) on the protection of natural persons with respect to the processing of personal data, is required. Afterwards, we describe how the PLAs are used to support model-based privacy and security analyses. Moreover, we explain how the analyses results can be used to refine PLAs. Our approach is supported by the CARiSMA tool. To evaluate the approach, we applied it to a real industry case study. 2016 IEEE.",

Subsequently securing a system, that is, integrating security mechanisms into the system's architecture can itself impact the system's safety, for instance deadlines could be missed due to an increase in computations and communications latencies. SysML-Sec addresses these issues with a modeldriven approach that promotes the collaboration between system designers and security experts at all design and development stages, e.g., requirements, attacks, partitioning, design, and validation. A central point of SysML-Sec is its partitioning stage during which safety-related and security-related functions are explored jointly and iteratively with regards to requirements and attacks. Once partitioned, the system is designed in terms of system's functions and security mechanisms, and formally verified from both the safety and the security perspectives. Our paper illustrates the whole methodology with the evaluation of a security mechanism added to an existing automotive system. Copyright 2015 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.",

        "abstract": "Software security is an essential requirement for software systems. However, recent investigation indicates that many software development methodologies do not explicitly include methods for incorporating information security into the software development life cycles (SDLC). This research investigates, using case study, the methodologies being used in software development in Saudi Arabia and describes a model for integrating security into the SDLC. The aim is to identify the appropriate means of introducing security measures much earlier in the SDLC. This model is designed to be an extension to the existing SDLC. For achieving the research objectives and answering the research questions, the research followed a case study research design in an information-based organization. The research identified various important elements as security standards, policies, processes being practiced, and tools used within SDLC projects. In this regard, recommendations and verification were gathered to elicit the actual activities that are appropriate to be conducted at each phase of SDLC. The non-functional security requirements were also found, to the use of fortify and hp alm for source code review and web application testing.

        "abstract": "Manifold approaches to security requirements engineering have been proposed, yet there is no consensus how to elicit, analyze, or express security needs. This perspective paper systematizes the problem space of security requirements engineering. Security needs result from the interplay of three dimensions: Threats, security goals, and system design. Elementary statements can be made in each dimension, but such one-dimensional requirements remain partial and insufficient. To understand security needs, one has to analyze their interaction. Distinct analysis tasks arise for each pair of dimensions and are supported by different techniques: Risk analysis, as in CORAS, between threats and security goals; security design, as exemplified by the framework of Haley et al., between goals and design; and security design analysis, such as Microsoft's threat modeling technique with data flow diagrams and STRIDE, between design and threats. All three perspectives are necessary to develop secure systems. Security requirements engineering must iterate through them, because threats determine the relevance of security goals, security design seeks ways to fulfill them, and design choices themselves influence threats and security goals. 2017 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Software security problems exist since the early days of computer systems. Operating system level approaches, network level approaches and machine level approaches are not sufficient for the security of software systems. Software security has gained attention in the recent years as an internal security issue of software systems as compared to external protective measures. Threat modeling is a technique being used to model threats into software systems. By applying threat modeling at the early stages of software development life cycle, all possible threats to software systems can be identified and mitigated and hence in this way, a more secure software application can be developed. Various threat modeling approaches such as CLASP, SDL, STRIDE, DREAD, TAM and Touch Points are being used by many organizations for threat modeling into software systems. But all of the approaches being used for threat modeling are based on informal and semi formal techniques. Formal methods are based on mathematics and provide state of the art techniques for secure software development. Formal methods had been used successfully in many critical systems such as CICS, Paris Railway System and British Air Traffic Control System etc. In the proposed approach VDM++, will be used for specification of core components: STRIDE, DREAD and Security Mechanisms. VDM++Tools will be used for type checking and proof obligations. 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The systematic processes exactly define the development cycle and help the development team follow the same development strategies and techniques, thus allowing a continuous improvement in the quality of the developed products. Likewise, it is important that the development process used integrates security aspects from the first stages at the same level as other functional and non-functional requirements. Grid systems allow us to build very complex information systems with different and remarkable features (interoperability between multiple security domains, cross-domain authentication and authorization, dynamic, heterogeneous and limited mobile devices, etc). With the development of wireless technology and mobile devices, the Grid becomes the perfect candidate for letting mobile users make complex works that add new computational capacity to the Grid. A methodology of development for secure mobile Grid systems is being defined. One of the activities of this methodology is the requirements analysis which is based in reusable use cases. In this paper, we will present a UML-extension for security use cases and Grid use case which capture the behaviour of this kind of systems. A detailed description of all these new use cases defined in the UML extension is necessary, describing the stereotypes, tagged values, constraints and graphical notation. We show an example of how to apply and use this extension for building the diagram of use cases and incorporating common security aspects for this kind of systems. Also, we will see how the diagrams built can be reused in the construction of others diagrams saving time and effort in this task.

This is happening because today more than ever software is becoming part of our lives and cybercrimes are constantly appearing. Despite its importance, its current practice in the software industry is still scarce. Indeed, software security problems are divided 50/50 between bugs and flaws. In particular, it remains a significant challenge for software practitioners in small software companies. Therefore, there is a need to support small companies in changing their existing ways of work to integrate these new and unfamiliar practices. The aim of this study is twofold. First, to help building an awareness of the software security process among practitioners in small companies. Second, to help the integration of these practices with software implementation process of ISO/IEC 29110 which results in an extension of the latter with additional activities identified from the industry best practices. Nevertheless, the extension proposal is to be performed selectively, based on the value of the software as an asset to the stakeholders and on stakeholders needs. 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",

In this paper, based on the domain model for IS security risk management (SRM) we propose a set of transformation guidelines to translate Secure Tropos models to the misuse case diagrams. We believe that such a model translation would help developers to elicit real security needs by integrating the security analysis starting from early requirement stages to all the stages of development process. The translation aligns the IS security concerns with functional requirements and maintains traceability of the security decisions to their origin. 2011 ACM.",

        "abstract": "E-government services usually process large amounts of confidential data. Therefore, security requirements for the communication between components have to be adhered in a strict way. Hence, it is of main interest that developers can analyze their modularized models of actual systems and that they can detect critical patterns. For this purpose, we present a general and formal framework for critical pattern detection and user-driven correction as well as possibilities for automatic analysis and verification at meta-model level. The technique is based on the formal theory of graph transformation, which we extend to transformations of type graphs with inheritance within a type graph hierarchy. We apply the framework to specify relevant security requirements. The extended theory is shown to fulfil the conditions of a weak adhesive HLR category allowing us to transfer analysis techniques and results shown for this abstract framework of graph transformation. In particular, we discuss how confluence analysis and parallelization can be used to enable parallel critical pattern detection and elimination.",

Despite many approaches to agile security requirements engineering in literature, there is little empirical research available on why there is limited adoption of these techniques. In this paper we describe a case study on challenges facing adoption of the Protection Poker game; a collaborative and lightweight software security risk estimation technique that is particularly suited for agile teams. Results show that Protection Poker has the potential to be adopted by agile teams. Key benefits identified include good discussions on security and the development project, increased knowledge and awareness of security, and contributions to security requirements. Challenges include managing discussions and the time it takes to play, ensuring confidence in the results from playing the game, and integrating results in a way that improves security of the end-product.",

        "abstract": "iStar is a goal-based requirements modelling language, being used in both industrial and academic projects of different domains. Often the language is extended to incorporate new constructs related to a particular application domain or to adjust it to practical situations during requirements modelling. Currently, the language is undergoing standardisation, and several studies have focused on the analysis of iStar variations to identify similarities and to define a core. This does not imply or constrain the need for iStar to continue to be extended. This paper contributes to the understanding of how iStar is extended by analysing how iStar researchers perform iStar extensions. To address this question, we followed a qualitative approach based on interviews involving 20 researchers from different research groups that proposed iStar extensions. The analysis revealed a good understanding about what extending a modelling language means and pointed out differences about how extensions are proposed. We discovered categories that impact positively on iStar extensions (such as reusing existing extensions, proposing extensions in abstract and concrete syntaxes, and creating new modelling tools), and other categories that impact negatively (such as modifying representations of the original constructs, proposing extensions in an ad hoc fashion and not carefully choosing graphical representations). We also evaluated the findings of interviews through an online survey answered by 30 iStar researchers. Finally, we proposed a set of guidelines to support the proposal for better future iStar extensions. \\\\textcopyright 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

RE techniques must be accessible to stakeholders with different backgrounds, so they can be empowered to effectively and efficiently contribute to building successful systems. When selecting an appropriate requirements engineering technique for a given context, one should consider the usability supported by each of the candidate techniques. The first step towards achieving this goal is to gather the best evidence available on the usability of RE approaches by performing a systematic literature review, to answer one research question: How is the usability of requirements engineering techniques and tools addressed? We systematically review articles published in the Requirements Engineering Journal, one of the main sources for mature work in RE, to motivate a research roadmap to make RE approaches more accessible to stakeholders with different backgrounds. 2016 ACM.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to propose the use of the Misuse Case and Obligation use case concepts in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in order to position security concerns at the very beginning of this process and to get \"secure applications\". These concepts are built upon the \"use case\" concept which is well known by the community of application developers in companies and by the application sponsors. The application sponsors are the key business stakeholders that fund and/or rely on the application for their business benefits. As stated in [1] and [3], the use case concept has proven helpful for the elicitation of, communication about and documentation of requirements [4]. So, we think it is easier to introduce security requirements in the development lifecycle by reusing and/or constructing security requirement artifacts around the use case and UML approach. \\\\textcopyright 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

One approach to requirements elicitation is based on the reuse of explicit knowledge. AMAN-DA is a requirement elicitation method that reuses encapsulated knowledge in security and domain ontologies to produce security requirements specifications. The main research question addressed in this paper is to what extent is AMAN-DA able to generate domain-specific security requirements? Following a well-documented process, a case study related to the maritime domain was undertaken with the goal to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of AMAN-DA for the elicitation and analysis of domain-specific security requirements. The usefulness of the method was also evaluated with a group of 12 experts. The paper demonstrates the elicitation of domain-specific security requirements by presenting the AMAN-DA method and its application. It describes the evaluation and reports some significant results and their implications for practice and future research, especially for the field of knowledge reuse in requirements engineering.",

        "abstract": "Designing security measures often involves trade-offs between various types of objectives. Multiple stakeholders may have conflicting demands and may have different ideas on how to resolve the resulting design conflicts. This paper reports on an application of value-sensitive design. Based on argumentation theory and social values, the paper develops a structured approach for discussing design conflicts, called value-based argumentation. The application domain examined in the paper is concerned with physical safety and security issues that arise in cross-border shipments. We first identify the kinds of dialogues that take place in this domain, in particular, audit dialogues to determine whether security measures comply with regulations. Based on argumentation theory we develop a formal language and a diagramming approach intended to facilitate parties in identifying, discussing and reaching agreement about security risks and corresponding mitigation measures. Trade-offs can be dealt with by making underlying values explicit. Using a stylized example, the approach was successfully taught to practitioners working with EU customs regulations. Practitioners generally found the approach helpful, in particular to bring out implicit underlying motivations. We conclude by discussing how our approach can be generalized to other kinds of dialogues involving design conflicts. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",
